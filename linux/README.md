# SandBlock — Linux Version
SandBlocks is a project that facilitates modding Turbowarp via the Terminal.

# Credits
Thanks to the Scratch Team for creating Scratch Gui & Scratch Vm but this code is based on the download of the Turbowarp fork so a big thank you to the original creator of the Turbowarp fork named Thomas Weber (aka: GarboMuffin)


### Skell Note
> I'm not very experienced in handling files with shell (.sh), so I decided that for Windows it was more viable to migrate it to a language like JS (Node) or Python

> Although I imagine that the idea of ​​doing it with the shell is to avoid having to install python or node precisely, but if you think about it, someone who is going to make a turbowarp mod will "necessarily" have to have node installed in order to compile it, or at least include it in some way in the final application that is developed
