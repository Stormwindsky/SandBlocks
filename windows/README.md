# SandBlock — Windows Version

SandBlocks is a project that facilitates modding Turbowarp via the Terminal.

> Important! — This JS script assumes that Node.js (a program required to compile and test the TurboWarp source code) is already installed, so if you don't have it installed, go ahead and do so. Same for Git.
